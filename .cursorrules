# AI Behavior Rules

1.  **Context Optimization**:
    - READ `CLAUDE.md` FIRST to understand the project structure.
    - DO NOT read `node_modules`, `dist`, or `public` folders.
    - Focus on `types.ts` and `contexts.tsx` for business logic.

2.  **Coding Standards**:
    - Use TypeScript with strict types.
    - Use TailwindCSS for styling.
    - Use Lucide React for icons (NO EMOJIS).

3.  **Architecture**:
    - This is a Supabase + React project.
    - All state changes must sync with Supabase.
